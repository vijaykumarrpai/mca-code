<!--	word_table.php
        Uses a function to split a given string of text into
        its constituant words. It also determines the frequency of
        occurrence of each word. The words are separated by whitespace
        or punctuation, possibly followed by whitespace. The
        punctuation can be a period, a comma, a semicolon, a colon,
        an exclamation point, or a questionmark.
        The main driver program calls the function and displays
        the results.
